EDIT LOG - demo/ static pages

Files replaced with static HTML replicas and shared CSS:
- index.html (home)  -> updated: added top nav, bottom nav, hero and event cards
- login.html (auth)  -> updated: full auth replica with toggle JS
- events.html        -> updated: events list and client-side filter
- event-details.html -> updated: event detail replica with banner, glass card and actions
- tickets.html       -> updated: ticket purchase replica
- dashboard.html     -> updated: user dashboard replica
- demo.css           -> replaced: replicated styles including navbar and bottom nav

NOT DONE (will require new pages or further assets):
- create-event.html  (JSX -> HTML not created: please confirm if you want this added)
- booking-success.html (JSX -> HTML not created)
- payment-info.html (JSX -> HTML not created)
- paid-payment.html (JSX -> HTML not created)
- profile.html (JSX -> HTML not created)

Reason: you asked to let me know before creating new pages. I updated only files that already exist in /demo. If you want the remaining JSX pages turned into static HTML files now, tell me and I will create them next.
